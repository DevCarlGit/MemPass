#### Description
The Memorable Password Generator is a simple application that lets you generate passwords, either traditional random-character passwords or memorable word-based passwords.
#### What Issue Does It Solve?
Strong passwords are more important than ever, yet the auto-generated "strong" passwords we get from most applications simply aren't memorable, and often aren't as strong as a memorable one would have been. I believe in making passwords that consist of multiple words, with some numbers or symbols tacked on at the end if it has to meet a certain criteria.
#### How Does It Work?
If one is generating a traditional password it pulls random letters from a list of characters that is influenced by the four checkboxes found under the Options label; Lower Case, Upper Case, Numerics, and Special Characters. One can specify the password size and copy it to the clipboard.

Should one want to generate a memorable password instead, the interface changes to include three big buttons for generating a cute password, an animal-related one, or a sports-related one. It then strings together the desired amount of words from the corresponding lists, optionally with a random number and/or special character at the end. This is the method I suggest!
